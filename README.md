kaomojify
==========

**Kaomojify** is a profanity filter for Google Chrome, based on @hpaolini's [tinyFilter extension.](https://github.com/hpaolini/tinyFilter-chrome)

It replaces all swear/curse/bad words in its list (`default.txt`) with a random selection from 300 kaomojis. Kaomojify's kaomoji list is from [Emot.es.](http://emot.es)

## Progress

- [x] Rename project to Kaomojify
- [x] Use random kaomojis in place of "***"
- [ ] **Material-ish UI**
- [ ] Update mechanism for kaomoji and profanity databases

## Download

Kaomojify is still in development. In the meantime, you can download the source code, unzip it somewhere on your computer, and point Chrome to that location through **Chrome Menu > More tools > Extensions > (enable developer mode) > Load unpacked extension.** The `.crx` download on the [Releases page](https://github.com/aureljared/kaomojify/releases) cannot be installed by Chrome 33+ due to security policies.
